## Verification Environment

The CoCoTb based Python test is developed as explained. The test drives inputs to the Design Under Test (Bitmanipulation Coprocessor module here) which takes in 4 32-bit inputs src1, src2, src3 and instruction and gives 32-bit output.

The values are assigned to the input port using
```
mav_putvalue_src1 = 0x0
mav_putvalue_src2 = 0x0
mav_putvalue_src3 = 0x0
mav_putvalue_instr = 0x40007033
```

The assert statement is used for comparing the Bitmanipulation Coprocessor outut to the expected value which is generated by the python model of Bitmanipulation Coprocessor.

The following assert statement is used :
```
error_message = f'Value mismatch DUT = {hex(dut_output)} does not match MODEL = {hex(expected_mav_putvalue)}'
assert dut_output == expected_mav_putvalue, error_message
```
